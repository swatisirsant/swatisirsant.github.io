However, with time, the water demand for any region changes due to population, migration, and lifestyles, so interventions need to be made to the existing WDNs. Therefore, the capacity expansion problem consists of determining the suitable interventions at various stages such that the required demands are met at minimum cost. The present study proposed a novel methodology for planning such interventions based on Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation and presented a combined Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution and DP (SADE-DP) methodology for solving the WDN expansion problems considering life cycle costs. The methodology is applied and tested on three benchmark WDNs, namely New York Tunnel (NYT), Two loop (TL), and Blacksburg (BLA) networks, and also for a real case study of the Badlapur WDN in Maharashtra, India. The proposed model solutions are validated by comparing them with other WDN expansion methods taken from the literature. The results indicate that the proposed SADE-DP approach is computationally efficient and provides cost-effective solutions by meeting desired performance levels at various stages, and can serve as a potential alternative for solving real-world WDN expansion problems.

Assessing WDN reliability with conventional hydraulic and mechanical reliability metrics may require substantial computational time and resources, which becomes more critical as the network size increases. Although the reliability surrogate measures (RSMs) such as entropy, resiliency, and network resilience may have computational benefits, they may perform differently under varying cases of hydraulic and mechanical failures. To account for both the reliabilities, this study proposed two indices that weight a combination of entropy and resiliency (CERI), and entropy and network resilience (CENRI) apart from the individual measures, and then assessed their performance via multiobjective design for three benchmark WDNs and also for a case study in India. The study adopted the EPANET 2 hydraulic simulator for extended period simulation (EPS) and nondominated sorting genetic algorithm- II (NSGA-II) for the multiobjective optimization of WDNs with maximization of RSMs (one at a time) and minimization of cost as two objectives. Hydraulic and mechanical reliabilities are estimated for the generated Pareto-optimal solutions to determine the association between each RSM and hydraulic/mechanical reliability. The numerical results of the study show that the proposed RSMs can serve as effective surrogate measures to account for hydraulic and mechanical reliability in the design of WDNs. The study recommends the use of CERI as a potential substitute for traditional hydraulic and mechanical reliability metrics to speed up the reliability computation and ensure reliable water supply for both branched and looped WDNs.

This paper presents an efficient way of reliability-baseddesign of WDNs using Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (SaDE) algorithm, which is an evolutionary optimization technique and animprovised version of the DE algorithm. The reliability of the WDNs is estimated as the level of demand satisfaction considering the mechanical failure of pipes. Simulations are performed using EPANET for generating the pressure and flow values using demand driven analysis, for various failure and working conditions. The efficacy of the proposed approach is tested by applyingitto two WDN problems. A thorough comparison is made between the performance of SaDE and DE algorithms. It is found that the SaDE converges much faster than DE, with high success rate, thus making it a more preferable option for solving WDN design problems and for reliability-based design of WDNs.

In this paper, a reliability based framework is presented for design of WDNs using self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE) algorithm. The framework includes three main components:a simulation model, a reliability assessment model and an optimization model. Simulation model uses EPANET toolkit for simulation of flows and pressure distribution in pipe network, and its outputs are used in reliability assessment model to determine the minimum cut sets. Reliability assessment model consists of determination of system and nodal reliabilities based on minimum cut sets. The reliability is estimated in terms of demand satisfaction subject to the mechanical failure of components. The optimization model finds optimal pipe diameters considering minimization of network cost as objective subject to a minimum level of reliability and other constraints, and the model is solved by using SaDE algorithm. The application of model is illustrated by applying it to a hypothetical WDN consisting of 17 pipes, 13 nodes, a supply source and a pump. On comparison of the results of study with previous studies, it is found that the present framework yields in better solutions and saves significant amount of computational time.
