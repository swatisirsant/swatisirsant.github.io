For effective design of Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), it is necessary to consider the reliability of the system subject  to  mechanical  and  hydraulic  failures.  In  this  paper,  a  reliability  based  framework  is  presented  for  design  of WDNs using self-adaptive differential evolution (SaDE) algorithm. The framework includes three main components:a  simulation  model,  a  reliability  assessment  model  and  an  optimization  model.  Simulation  model  uses  EPANET toolkit  for  simulation  of  flows  and  pressure  distribution  in  pipe  network,  and  its  outputs  are  used  in  reliability assessment  model  to  determine  the  minimum  cut  sets.  Reliability  assessment  model  consists  of  determination  of system and nodal reliabilities based on minimum cut sets. The reliability is estimated in terms of demand satisfaction subject  to  the  mechanical  failure  of  components.  The  optimization  model  finds  optimal  pipe  diameters  considering minimization  of  network  cost  as  objective  subject  to  a  minimum  level  of  reliability  and  other  constraints,  and  the model  is  solved  by  using  SaDE  algorithm.  The  application  of  model  is  illustrated  by  applying  it  to  a  hypothetical WDN  consisting  of  17  pipes,  13  nodes,  a  supply  source  and  a  pump.  On  comparison  of  the  results  of  study  with previous  studies,  it  is  found  that  the  present  framework  yields  in  better  solutions  and  saves  significant  amount  of computational time.
